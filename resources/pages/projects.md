# Selected Projects

### racknews

[GitHub](https://github.com/axocomm/racknews2)<br>
A simple RackTables API and reporting tool
(WIP rewrite of [RackNews](https://github.com/axocomm/racknews))

### xyzyxyzy.xyz

[GitHub](https://github.com/axocomm/xyzyxyzy.xyz)<br>
This site is a simple Flask application that renders pages from Markdown files.
It is running inside a Docker container hosted by Debian.

Styles are from scratch but do start with the
[CSS Reset](http://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/css/reset/). Navigation icons
come courtesy of [Font Awesome](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/).

### lcdeploy

[GitHub](https://github.com/axocomm/lcdeploy)<br>
This is a Ruby Gem that allows deployments to
be specified using a number of straightforward step helper functions
(`create_directory`, `copy_file`, `clone_repository`, etc.) and other
Ruby code in an [`lcdfile`](https://github.com/axocomm/xyzy-site/blob/master/lcdfile).
It tries to be a little more robust than using `Rakefile`s or shell
scripts without getting to the level of Chef or Ansible and
facilitates deploys of basic applications from individual project
directories using a single file.

### vagrant-wordpress

[GitHub](https://github.com/axocomm/vagrant-wordpress)<br>
A Vagrant setup that aims to provide quick and easy access to a LEMP stack and
ready-to-use WordPress installation for local development

### puff-puff-dash

[GitHub](https://github.com/axocomm/puff-puff-dash)<br>
A link management application mostly written to experiment with
ClojureScript and Reagent. Allows management and querying of links
(favorite music, videos, images, etc.) from various sources.
Currently wants local JSON, but eventually I hope to have it interact
directly with the APIs of SoundCloud, Reddit, YouTube, and more.

### wp-docker-dev

[GitHub](https://github.com/axocomm/wp-docker-dev)<br>
A simple Docker-based WordPress setup that provides an easy-to-use environment for
working on multiple local development installations

### utils

[GitHub](https://github.com/axocomm/utils)<br>
Just a few small utilities.

Most of these are perpetually WIP. More to come soon (hopefully).
