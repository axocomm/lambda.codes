ready-to-use WordPress installation for local development

### puff-puff-dash

[GitHub](https://github.com/axocomm/puff-puff-dash)<br>
A link management application mostly written to experiment with
ClojureScript and Reagent. Allows management and querying of links

Currently wants local JSON, but eventually I hope to have it interact
directly with the APIs of SoundCloud, Reddit, YouTube, and more.
