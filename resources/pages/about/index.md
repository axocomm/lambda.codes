# About

Hello. My name is Trevor, and I am a software engineer focusing on
backend web development, DevOps, and some Unix system
administration. I grew up at the Jersey Shore and currently reside in
Lower Merion Township, PA with [Linus the
cat](/public/img/linus-ok.png).

Aside from work and projects, I enjoy playing bass guitar, smoking my
pipe, and wandering around the city.

For more information, feel free to have a look at my
[experience](/about/experience) or a few [projects](/projects).
