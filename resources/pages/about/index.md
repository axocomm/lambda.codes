# About

Hello. My name is Trevor, and I am a software engineer focusing on
backend web development, DevOps, and some Unix system
administration. I grew up at the Jersey Shore and currently reside in
the Fairmount section of Philadelphia with Fizzbin the cat.

I am currently happily employed at Philadelphia startup Picwell, where
I help out with DevOps and feature development for our health care
plan recommendation platform. Aside from work and projects, I enjoy
playing bass guitar, smoking my pipe, and wandering around the city.

For more information, feel free to have a look at my
[experience](/about/experience), a few [projects](/projects), or
my [full r&eacute;sum&eacute;](https://www.cs.drexel.edu/~tm/assets/files/resume.pdf).
