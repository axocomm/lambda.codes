# About

Hello. My name is Trevor, and I am a software engineer focusing on web
development, DevOps, and some Unix system administration. I grew up at the
Jersey Shore and currently reside in the Walnut Hill section of Philadelphia.

At the moment I am a full stack Clojure developer at [Relay
Network](http://www.relaynetwork.com/) and lead developer at ProTech
Internet Group.

Aside from work and projects, I enjoy playing bass guitar, smoking my
pipe, and wandering around the city.

For more information, feel free to have a look at my
[experience](/about/experience) and a few [projects](/projects).
