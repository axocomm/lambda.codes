## Employment History

### Picwell (present)

At Picwell, I perform feature development and help out with DevOps for
our Medicare plan recommendation platform. This primarily involves
writing Python (most notably Flask and Pandas), Go, and Scala as well
as working with Chef, AWS, and Jenkins.

Recent endeavors include improving service deployments, automating
data ingestion and processing tasks, analyzing and producing reports
of AEP (Medicare annual election period) and non-AEP API traffic,
creating a CLI tool and Python library for quick querying and
retrieval of logs stored in Elasticsearch, and implementing a new load
testing suite and tooling using [Gatling](https://gatling.io/), which
was subsequently used to evaluate service performance under various
conditions.

### ProTech Internet Group (present)

I began working on small projects with ProTech in 2012 and continued
over the next few years taking on larger responsibilities. This
position mostly entails WordPress plugin and theme development but
often involves full site builds or extensive modifications. Recent
projects include support and development for a custom eCommerce
platform, a comprehensive online shopping research tool leveraging
[Scrapy](https://scrapy.org/) and [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/),
a third-party media platform integration plugin for WordPress, and an
Android application for a YC-backed startup.

I also work on maintaining infrastructure, building internal tools,
and much more. In late 2015, I was even involved in an [SEO keyword
study](http://backlinko.com/search-engine-ranking) of 1,000,000 Google
search results that was even written about in a few different
publications, including
[TechCrunch](http://techcrunch.com/2016/02/12/study-says-data-driven-seo-might-be-possible/).

### Relay Network

At Relay Network, I was a full stack developer working primarily with
Clojure. Here, I developed features for multiple backend services,
worked with huge amounts of data, diagnosed and fixed issues of all
kinds, and more.

Backend services were all written in Clojure, frontends for portals
and the actual Relay application used Backbone.js, Ruby was used for
testing (RSpec) and automation/tasks (Rake), Ansible was used for
service deployment, and infrastructure was all hosted in AWS.

The list of projects is quite long but includes an overhaul of the
internal file processing system for customer data management and
messaging, a few brand new client-facing APIs, and 2-token IVR for new
member onboarding.

### SevOne

SevOne began as my second co-op with Drexel and continued part time
through the fall and winter before leaving for Vimbly. I resumed
briefly in Fall of 2015.

For the first year, I worked on the Dragon Slayers investigating
escalated support tickets and identifying and fixing defects. I
primarily took on tasks related to the web application component and
reporting framework of SevOne NMS, particularly with C++, PHP, and
JavaScript (vanilla, ExtJS, jQuery). I also worked on diagnosing and
fixing issues with appliance clustering (namely problems adding
peers), licensing, browser compatibility, and MySQL replication.

After I returned, I transferred to the Honey Badgers, who dealt almost
exclusively with fixing defects.

### Facebook

In the summer of 2015, I was a Production Engineering intern at
Facebook's headquarters in Menlo Park, CA. Here, I worked on the PE
Mobile team on several projects.

My primary project was an automated (almost touchless) Android device
provisioning tool. This tool is used for preparing devices out of the
box for installation in the mobile device labs, performing tasks such
as rooting the phone, installing a custom ROM, and making necessary
configuration changes for remote access and management. By the
summer's end this tool supported Nexus 4 and 5 (and theoretically most
other at-least-close-to-vanilla Android devices) and was used to
provision a bunch of phones at the office and recently a bunch more
*remotely* in the Prineville, Oregon datacenter.

The second project was a battery monitoring script for Android and iOS
devices in the device labs. It gathered battery voltage information
and submitted results to a
[Scuba](https://www.facebook.com/notes/facebook-engineering/under-the-hood-data-diving-with-scuba/10150599692628920/)
dataset in order to reveal potential correlations between device
performance and battery health. This was also a nice introduction to
Chef through getting the tool deployed to the device host machines.

The final project was a device lab status dashboard that displayed the
layout of devices in their racks mounted on the walls, their current
health state, and various other details gathered from multiple data
sources.

Python, PHP, and Hack were primary languages in use in this
position. Mercurial was used as source control for most of the
repositories I worked on and Phabricator was used for source code
exploration, code reviews, and much more.

### Vimbly

For the spring of 2015, I worked for New York City startup Vimbly as a
web developer intern. Responsibilities here started day one with
beginning split testing with [Optimizely](https://www.optimizely.com/)
and cleanly integrating these tests into the Vimbly website. This soon
turned into an almost constant stream of various frontend and backend
(CakePHP) projects primarily concerning the internal administrative
dashboard and VimblyBot system.

A few larger projects include the integration of CasperJS into the
VimblyBot infrastructure and the replacement of the existing bot
batcher with a new, more maintainable scheduler daemon. Other
operational duties and extra projects involved working with MySQL
replication, AWS, and Plack.

### Drexel University College of Computing and Informatics

Prior to and for my first co-op, I worked with the system
administrator at the Department of Computer Science on maintaining CS
and Math department hardware; server installation and configuration;
and management with RackTables, Nagios, and Puppet. I also provided
technical support to faculty and students, and began working on a thin
client lab solution using [LTSP](http://ltsp.org/).

### AT&T Labs

For the summer of my freshman year, I worked at AT&T in Middletown, NJ
as a Summer IT intern. Here, I planned and developed an Android
application using some of AT&T's (then) new mobile APIs.

This summer program served as a dry run of the AT&T Summer Coding
Challenge. This entailed ensuring that deadlines were realistic,
projects were appropriate, and requirements were clear. It also
involved implementing the project, for which I wrote a
voice-controlled Reddit browser for Android using AT&T's Speech
Recognition API.
