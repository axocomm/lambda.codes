## Education

B.S. Software Engineering, Drexel University (2011-present, currently on hold)

## Employment History

### Relay Network (present)

I have recently begun a my first full time software engineer position
at Relay Network. I will be doing full stack development, particularly
in Clojure.

### ProTech Internet Group (present)

I began working on small projects with ProTech in 2012 and continued over the
next few years taking on larger responsibilities. This position mostly entails
WordPress plugin and theme development but often involves full site builds,
extensive modifications, and a great variety of other development tasks.

I also work on maintaining development and staging servers, building internal
tools, and much more. Recently, I was also involved in an
[SEO keyword study](http://backlinko.com/search-engine-ranking) of 1,000,000
Google search results that was even featured on
[TechCrunch](http://techcrunch.com/2016/02/12/study-says-data-driven-seo-might-be-possible/).

### SevOne

SevOne began as my second co-op with Drexel and continued part time through the
fall and winter before leaving for Vimbly.

For the first year, I worked on the Dragon Slayers investigating escalated
support tickets and identifying and fixing defects. I primarily took on tasks
related to the web application component and reporting framework of SevOne NMS,
particularly with C++, PHP, and JavaScript (vanilla, ExtJS, jQuery). I also
worked on diagnosing and fixing issues with appliance clustering (namely
problems adding peers), licencing, browser compatibility, and MySQL replication.

I returned to SevOne part time for the fall term and transferred to the Honey
Badgers, who deal almost exclusively with fixing defects.

### Facebook

Over the summer, I was a Production Engineering intern at Facebook's
headquarters in Menlo Park, CA. Here, I worked on the PE Mobile team on a few
projects.

My main project was an automated (almost touchless) Android device provisioning
tool. This tool is used for preparing devices out of the box for installation in
the mobile device labs, performing tasks such as rooting the phone, installing a
custom ROM, and making necessary configuration changes for remote access and
management. By the summer's end this tool supported Nexus 4 and 5 (and
theoretically any other reasonably open, i.e. not too locked down, device) and
was used to provision a bunch of phones at the office and recently a bunch more
*remotely* in the Prineville, OR datacentre.

The second project was a battery monitoring script for Android and iOS devices
in the device labs. It gathered battery voltage information and submitted
results to a
[Scuba](https://www.facebook.com/notes/facebook-engineering/under-the-hood-data-diving-with-scuba/10150599692628920/)
dataset in order to reveal potential correlations between device performance and
battery health. This was also a nice introduction to Chef through getting the
tool deployed to the device host machines.

The final project was a device lab status dashboard that displayed the layout of
devices on the walls, their current health state, and various details on hover
gathered from multiple data sources.

Python, PHP, and Hack were primary languages in use in this position. Mercurial
was used as source control for most of the repositories I worked on and Phabricator
was used for source code exploration, code reviews, and much more.

### Vimbly

Last spring, I worked for New York City startup Vimbly as a web
developer intern. Responsibilities here started day one with beginning
split testing with [Optimizely](https://www.optimizely.com/) and
cleanly integrating these tests into the Vimbly website. This soon
turned into an almost constant stream of various frontend and backend
(CakePHP) projects primarily concerning the internal administrative
dashboard and VimblyBot system.

A few larger projects include the integration of CasperJS into the
VimblyBot infrastructure and the replacement of the existing bot
batcher with a new, cleaner scheduler daemon. Other operational duties
and extra projects involved working with MySQL replication, AWS, and
Plack.

### Drexel University College of Computing and Informatics

Prior to and for my first co-op, I worked with the system administrator
at the Department of Computer Science maintaining lab hardware, server
installation and configuration, and plenty of work with RackTables,
Nagios, and Puppet. I also provided technical support to faculty and
students, and began working on a thin client lab solution using
[LTSP](http://ltsp.org/).

### AT&T Labs

For the summer of my freshman year, I interned at AT&T in Middletown, NJ
as a Summer IT intern. Here, I planned and developed an Android application
using some of AT&T's (then) new mobile APIs.
