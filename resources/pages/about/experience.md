## Employment History

### SevOne (present)

SevOne began as my second co-op with Drexel and continued part time
through the fall and winter of 2014-2015 before leaving for Vimbly. I
resumed briefly after returning from California, and after several
years recently returned (having finally shed "intern" from my title).

As an intern, I primarily took on tasks related to the web application
component and reporting framework of SevOne NMS, particularly with
C++, PHP, and JavaScript (vanilla, ExtJS, jQuery). I also worked on
diagnosing and fixing issues with appliance clustering (namely
problems adding peers), licensing, browser compatibility, and MySQL
replication.

Since returning, I've been focusing more on critical issues involving
data loss, system configuration and performance, and relatively newer
offerings like Data Insight and Universal Collectors both during
business hours and as part of a developer on-call rotation.

### ProTech Internet Group (present)

I began working on small projects with ProTech in 2012 and continued
over the next few years taking on larger responsibilities. This
position mostly entails WordPress plugin and theme development but
often involves full site builds or extensive modifications. Recent
projects include support and development for a custom eCommerce
platform, a comprehensive online shopping research tool leveraging
[Scrapy](https://scrapy.org/) and [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/),
a third-party media platform integration plugin for WordPress, and an
Android application for a Y Combinator startup.

I also work on maintaining infrastructure, building internal tools,
and much more. In late 2015, I was even involved in an [SEO keyword
study](http://backlinko.com/search-engine-ranking) of 1,000,000 Google
search results that was even written about in a few different
publications, including
[TechCrunch](http://techcrunch.com/2016/02/12/study-says-data-driven-seo-might-be-possible/).

### Picwell

At Picwell, I performed feature development and helped out with DevOps
for our health care plan recommendation platform. This primarily
involved writing Python (most notably Flask and Pandas), Go, and Scala
as well as working with Chef, AWS, and Jenkins.

Endeavors included improving service deployments, automating data
ingestion and processing tasks, analyzing and producing reports of AEP
(Medicare annual election period) and non-AEP API traffic, designing
and building brand new versions of several services, and implementing
a new load testing suite and tooling using
[Gatling](https://gatling.io/) for evaluating application performance
under various conditions.

### Relay Network

At Relay Network, I was a full stack developer working primarily with
Clojure. Here, I developed features for multiple backend services,
worked with huge amounts of data, diagnosed and fixed issues of all
kinds, and more.

Backend services were all written in Clojure, frontends for portals
and the actual Relay application used Backbone.js, Ruby was used for
testing (RSpec) and automation/tasks (Rake), Ansible was used for
service deployment, and infrastructure was all hosted in AWS.

The list of projects is quite long but includes an overhaul of the
internal file processing system for customer data management and
messaging, a few brand new client-facing APIs, and 2-token IVR for new
member onboarding.

### Facebook

In the summer of 2015, I was a Production Engineering intern at
Facebook's headquarters in Menlo Park, CA. Here, I worked on the PE
Mobile team on several projects involving the use of PHP and Hack,
Python, Phabricator, Chef, and Mercurial.

My primary project was an automated (almost touchless) Android device
provisioning tool. This tool is used for preparing devices out of the
box for installation in the mobile device labs, performing tasks such
as rooting the phone, installing a custom ROM, and making necessary
configuration changes for remote access and management. By the
summer's end this tool supported Nexus 4 and 5 (and theoretically most
other at-least-close-to-vanilla Android devices) and was able to be
used to provision sets of phones both locally as well as *remotely* in
the Prineville, OR datacenter.

The second project was a battery monitoring script for Android and iOS
devices in the device labs. It gathered battery voltage information
and submitted results to a
[Scuba](https://www.facebook.com/notes/facebook-engineering/under-the-hood-data-diving-with-scuba/10150599692628920/)
dataset in order to reveal potential correlations between device
performance and battery health.

The final project was a web-based device lab status dashboard that
displayed the layout of devices in their wall-mounted shelves, their
current health state, and various other details gathered from multiple
data sources.

### Vimbly

For the spring of 2015, I worked for New York City startup Vimbly as a
web developer intern. Responsibilities here started day one with
beginning split testing with [Optimizely](https://www.optimizely.com/)
and cleanly integrating these tests into the Vimbly website. This soon
turned into an almost constant stream of various frontend and backend
(CakePHP) projects primarily concerning the internal administrative
dashboard, customer-facing booking and payment, and VimblyBot system.

A few larger projects include the integration of CasperJS into the
VimblyBot infrastructure and the replacement of the existing bot
batcher (used to fetch and ingest clients' event schedules) with a
new, more maintainable daemon. Other operational duties and extra
projects involved working with MySQL replication, AWS, and Plack.

### Drexel University College of Computing and Informatics

Prior to and for my first co-op, I worked with the system
administrator at the Department of Computer Science on maintaining CS
and Math department hardware; server installation and configuration;
and management with RackTables, Nagios, and Puppet. I also provided
technical support to faculty and students, and began working on a thin
client lab solution using [LTSP](http://ltsp.org/).

### AT&T Labs

For the summer of my freshman year, I worked at AT&T in Middletown, NJ
as a Summer IT intern. Here, I planned and developed an Android
application using some of AT&T's (then) new mobile APIs.

This summer program served as a dry run of the AT&T Summer Coding
Challenge. This entailed ensuring that deadlines were realistic,
project selection was appropriate, and requirements were clear. It
also involved implementing the project itself, for which I wrote a
voice-controlled Reddit browser for Android using AT&T's Speech
Recognition API.
