## Education

B.S. Software Engineering, Drexel University (2011-2016, currently on hiatus)

## Employment History

### Vistar Media (present)

I'm currently leading Support Engineering efforts at Vistar
Media. This team is largely responsible for addressing escalations
from frontline Support, Product, and Supply teams as well as serving
as an interconnect with the Engineering organization at-large.

Here, I, along with several others within SE, deal with various
requests ranging from making configuration, data, and code changes to
performing deep investigations of improper or unexpected behaviour
across all parts of the Vistar ad platform; fixing, comprehensively
documenting, and delegating to specific teams as necessary.

As well, the Support Engineering team is responsible for handling and
monitoring weekly releases as well as being points of contact for
outages and other such incidents that may occur.

### SevOne

SevOne began as my second co-op with Drexel and continued part time
through the fall and winter of 2014-2015 before leaving for Vimbly. I
resumed briefly after returning from California, and several years
later came back once more (having then finally shed "intern" from my
title).

As an intern, I primarily took on tasks related to the web application
component and reporting framework of SevOne NMS, particularly with
C++, PHP, and JavaScript (vanilla, ExtJS, jQuery). I also worked on
diagnosing and fixing issues with appliance clustering (namely
problems adding peers), licensing, browser compatibility, and MySQL
replication.

Once I went full-time, I began focusing more on critical issues
involving data loss, system configuration and performance, as well as
relatively newer offerings like Data Insight, Data Bus, and Universal
Collectors both during business hours and as part of a developer
on-call rotation.

### ProTech Internet Group

I began working on small projects with ProTech in 2012 and continued
over the next few years taking on larger responsibilities. This
position mostly entailed WordPress plugin and theme development but
often involved full site builds or extensive modifications. Projects
included support and development for a custom eCommerce platform, a
comprehensive online shopping research tool leveraging
[Scrapy](https://scrapy.org/) and [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/),
a third-party media platform integration plugin for WordPress, and an
Android application for a Y Combinator startup.

I also worked on maintaining infrastructure, building internal tools,
and much more. In late 2015, I was involved in an SEO keyword study of
1,000,000 Google search results that was even written about in a few
different publications, including
[TechCrunch](http://techcrunch.com/2016/02/12/study-says-data-driven-seo-might-be-possible/).

### Picwell

At Picwell, I performed feature development and helped out with DevOps
for our health care plan recommendation platform. This primarily
involved writing Python (most notably Flask and Pandas), Go, and Scala
as well as working with Chef, AWS, and Jenkins.

Endeavours here included improving service deployments, automating
data ingestion and processing tasks, analyzing and producing reports
of AEP (Medicare annual election period) and non-AEP API traffic,
designing and building brand new versions of several services, and
implementing a new load testing suite and tooling using
[Gatling](https://gatling.io/) for evaluating application performance
under various conditions.

### Relay Network

At Relay Network, I was a full stack developer working primarily with
Clojure. Here, I developed features for multiple backend services,
worked with huge amounts of data, diagnosed and fixed issues of all
kinds, and more.

Backend services were all written in Clojure, frontends for portals
and the actual Relay application used Backbone.js, Ruby was used for
testing (RSpec) and automation/tasks (Rake), Ansible was used for
service deployment, and infrastructure was all hosted in AWS.

The list of projects is quite long but includes an overhaul of the
internal file processing system for customer data management and
messaging, a few brand new client-facing APIs, and 2-token IVR for new
member onboarding.

### Facebook

In the summer of 2015, I was a Production Engineering intern at
Facebook's headquarters in Menlo Park, CA. Here, I worked on the PE
Mobile team on several projects involving the use of PHP and Hack,
Python, Phabricator, Chef, and Mercurial.

My primary project was an automated (almost touchless) Android device
provisioning tool. This tool is used for preparing devices out of the
box for installation in the mobile device labs, performing tasks such
as rooting the phone, installing a custom ROM, and making necessary
configuration changes for remote access and management. By the
summer's end this tool supported Nexus 4 and 5 (and theoretically most
other at-least-close-to-vanilla Android devices) and was able to be
used to provision sets of phones both locally as well as *remotely* in
the Prineville, Oregon data centre.

My second project was a battery monitoring script for Android and iOS
devices in the device labs. It gathered battery voltage information
and submitted results to a
[Scuba](https://research.facebook.com/publications/scuba-diving-into-data-at-facebook/)
dataset in order to reveal potential correlations between device
performance and battery health.

As a final project, a web-based device lab status dashboard was
devised which displayed the layout of devices in their wall-mounted
shelves, their current health state, and various other details
gathered from multiple data sources.

### Vimbly

For the spring of 2015, I worked for New York City startup Vimbly as a
web developer intern. Responsibilities here started day one with
beginning split testing with [Optimizely](https://www.optimizely.com/)
and cleanly integrating these tests into the Vimbly website. This soon
turned into an almost constant stream of various frontend and backend
(CakePHP) projects primarily concerning the internal administrative
dashboard, customer-facing booking and payment, and VimblyBot system.

A few larger projects include the integration of CasperJS into the
VimblyBot infrastructure and the replacement of the existing bot
batcher (used to fetch and ingest clients' event schedules) with a
new, more maintainable daemon. Other operational duties and extra
projects involved working with MySQL replication, AWS, and Plack.

### Drexel University College of Computing and Informatics

Prior to and for my first co-op, I worked with the system
administrator at the Department of Computer Science on maintaining CS
and Math department hardware; server installation and configuration;
and management with RackTables, Nagios, and Puppet. I also provided
technical support to faculty and students, and began working on a thin
client lab solution using [LTSP](https://ltsp.org).

### AT&T Labs

For the summer of my freshman year, I worked at AT&T in Middletown, NJ
as a Summer IT intern. Here, I planned and developed an Android
application using some of AT&T's (then) new mobile APIs.

This summer program served as a dry run of the AT&T Summer Coding
Challenge. This entailed ensuring that deadlines were realistic,
project selection was appropriate, and requirements were clear. It
also involved implementing the project itself, for which I wrote a
voice-controlled Reddit browser for Android using AT&T's Speech
Recognition API.
